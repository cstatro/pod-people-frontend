## Short Description
Pod People is an web application designed to allow users to curate lists of podcasts and single episodes any way they want. Users are also able to search through lists of podcasts created by other users with the results being sorted by relevancy. While users browse through the website they can listen to podcasts via an audioplayer docked in the navbar.
